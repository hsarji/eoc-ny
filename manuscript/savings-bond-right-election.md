## Savings Bonds and the Elective Share

<!-- 
The problem is the SCOTUS decision in *Free v. Bland* and the fact that EPTL 13-3.1 (Rights of payees in non-transferrable United States savings) provides an override (albeit a tenuous one) only for EPTL 5-1.1-A (right of election), not EPTL 5-3.1 (family exemption).

See:   

Eileen Schwab has an excellent article on savings bonds:

> EPTL ยง 13-3.1 provides that the survivorship pro- visions of U.S. savings bonds will not be impaired or defeated by any statute or rule of law governing the transfer of property by will, gift or intestacy except as provided in ยง 5-1.1-A.(n19: See, New York State Assembly, Memorandum in Support of Legislation, Bill No. A8316-B, SR21011 at 5 (1992).) Consequently, there is no doubt that New York intentionally ignored the hold- ing in Free. No case has challenged the provisions as yet. It would seem such a challenge would prevail and that a spousal right of election in U.S. obliga- tions would be defeated.
