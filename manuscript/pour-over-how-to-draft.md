## How do you draft it? 

Do you simply incorporate the dispositive terms of the trust or do you restate the trust? There are pros and cons to each approach. 

Two ways to draft a pour over will: 

1. The will referes to the revocable living trust into which the decedent's assets are to pour over and whose terms will be followed. 
2. The will, in addition to so referencing the revocable living trust, makes provision for a situation in which the trust is not in existence at the time of the decedent's death, or is found to be invalid for any reason. The Will then goes on to spell out all the dispositive terms just as the living trust had.
