## When do you use it? 

Generally, with a revocable trust as a back-stop in case the trust isn't fully funded. But, surprisingly, there is a scenario where a pour over will shouldn't be used.




A pour over will might not make sense in the following scenario from Martin M. Shenkman, *The Complete Living Trust Program* (2000): 

> NOTE: If you are part of a relationship with a nonmarried partner that your family members may not approve of, a living trust may minimize scrutiny, interference, and potential challenge. Your revocable living trust may have a degree of confidentiality that a will does not. If you transfer only a portion of your assets into the trust, retaining the remaining assets in your estate, family members adverse to your relationship may not even realize that a trust governing some portion of your estate exists. This can be an effective planning technique. If you use this approach, don't use a 'pour over' provision in your will.
