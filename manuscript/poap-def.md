## What is a "Power of Appointment"?

New York defines a "power of appointment" differently than federal law. Consequently, the power to "change the remainder person" and a "power of appointment" can have different rules apply to each power but are treated uniformly in New York. <!-- 2024-03-08 -->  

The definition of "power of appointment" in New York allows the power to be "reserved." EPTL 10-3.1(a). <!-- www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/EPT/10-3.1 -->

In contrast, under federal gift tax law the term "power of appointment" does not include powers reserved by a donor; therefore, someone other than the donor must hold the power. [Reg. § 25.2514–1(b)(2)](www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/25.2514-1).
