## How is a specific devise treated differently from a residuary devise? 



<!-- 
+ Section 11-2.1 Principal and income
- https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/EPT/11-2.1
+ . . .  
+ (d) Income earned during administration of a decedent's estate.
	+ (3) 
		+ (A) The residuary beneficiaries are entitled to the rent from **the decedent's real property, not specifically disposed of,** from the date of death, in proportion to their respective interests under the will, unless the fiduciary, pursuant to a power to distribute in kind, allocates all or part of such property in whole or partial satisfaction of a pecuniary disposition in trust, in which event the rent from the property so allocated shall be distributed, as of the date of death, to the trustee of such disposition.
		+ (B) This subparagraph applies to wills of decedents dying before, on or after its effective date, provided, however, that it shall not be so applied as to require residuary beneficiaries to repay to the estate any distributions of income **from real property, not specifically disposed of,** which were actually made to such beneficiaries prior to such effective date.
