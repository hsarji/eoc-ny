A limited power of appointment is not appropriate if you are doing a transfer to a living caregiver child or sibling with equity interest because the limited power of appointment could defeat the intent of an exempt transfer. <!-- Steven Kass, Re: can a grantor reserve the right in a deed to change the remainderman, NYSBA TE LS, March 8, 2024: "Of course the power of appointment would not be appropriate if you were doing a transfer to a living caregiver a child or sibling with the equity interest because that could defeat the intent of an exempt transfer." -->
