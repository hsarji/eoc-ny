# Confusion in the Law

This book is organized into five sections corresponding to legal reasoning: Fact, Issue, Rule, Application, and Conclusion ("FIRAC").

FIRAC is a fundamental tool that is taught to law students in their first year of law school. It has several variations, including IRAC and CRARC.[^lebovits-cracking]

We can use the FIRAC method not only to structure our legal writing, but also as a forensic tool to examine legal analysis.

In fact, we can take every sentence written in the law and label it as F, I, R, A, or C.

In this book, I will use FIRAC as a tool to analyze various areas of confusion in the law of wills, trusts, and estates. I hope that this discussion will teach you something new about this vast area of the law and sharpen your legal reasoning skills.
