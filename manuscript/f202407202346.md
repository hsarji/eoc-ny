## FIRAC Is Fundamental 

FIRAC is the fundamental method of legal reasoning that is taught to law students in their first year of law school. It has several variations, including IRAC and CRARC.[^lebovits-cracking] 

We use FIRAC to organize our writing globally. 

We use FIRAC to organize the structure of each paragraph. 

We can even take every sentence written in the law and label it as F, I, R, A, or C.
