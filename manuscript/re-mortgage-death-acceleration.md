## Testamentary disposition of real property to strangers & due on sale clause

### Facts

Real estate owner wants to give real property to several beneficiaries upon his death and does not want the property sold. (He wants them to receive it in-kind.) The property is mortgaged.

I tried researching this issue and have yet to come across a discussion of it in the drafting resources that I have.  


### Rule

[The Garn-St Germain Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/1701j-3)

### Questions 

**(1) Will**

Can a specific devise to strangers of real property that is subject to a mortgage trigger the due on sale clause? 

I'm reviewing the Garn-St Germain Act, and a devise to strangers does not seem to fall within any of the exemptions: 

- the strangers are not joint tenants or tenants by the entirety - (d)(3)
- the strangers are not relatives - (d)(5) 
- the strangers are not spouses or children of the borrower - (d)(6) 
- a devise is not an inter vivos trust - (d)(8) 

**(2) Trust**

I see that there is an exemption for an inter vivos trust ((d)(8)), but it doesn't help after the settlor dies because there will be "a transfer of rights of occupancy in the property," which takes us out of the exemption. 

If there is no exemption from the due on sale clause, then: 

- (1) What drafting / estate planning recommendations do you have?
- (2) What steps should be taken during the administration of the estate? 
- (3) Should the bank be put on notice and should their approval be obtained while the planning is being done or during administration, or should one be silent and hope that the bank doesn't find out and that the beneficiaries continue paying the mortgage?


### Two ways to read (d)(3)

**Broad Interpreation.** One way to read (d)(3): 

```
a transfer by 
              devise,
              descent, or
              operation of law on the death of 
                 a joint tenant or tenant by the 
                 entirety;
```

With the broad interpration, (d)(3) applies to every devise or descent. 

**Narrow Interpretation.** Another way to read (d)(3): 

```
a transfer 
           by 
               devise,
               descent, or
               operation of law
           on the death
           of a 
               joint tenant or  
               tenant by the entirety;
```

With the narrow interprtation, (d)(3) applyies to transfers that meet three elements: (1) by . . ., (2) on ..., and (3) of ....

In other words, we need to have a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety dying for the exemption to apply. 

The committee report that accompanied the Garn-St Germain Act supports both ways of reading (d)(3).

From Senate Report No. 97-536 to Accompany S. 2897, September 3, 1982: 

p.24

> Limitations on the enforcement of due-on-sale clauses  
>   
> The Committee believes that it would be unfair and inappropriate for lenders to enforce due-on-sale clauses under certain circumstances-such as involuntary transfers resulting from the death of a borrower, transfers which rearrange ownership rights within a family, or transfers resulting from a separation or dissolution of a marriage. . . . 

p.58

> Section 341(d)(3) prohibits the exercise of an option pursuant to a due-on-strike [sic] clause if the property is transferred to a joint tenant, or a tenant by the entirety, by devise, descent or operation of law.  
> . . .  
> Section 341(d)(5) prohibits the exercise of an option pursuant to a due-on-sale clause if the property is transferred to a relative and the transfer is a result of the death of the borrower.

So, p.24 supports the interpretation that a due-on-sale clause shouldn't apply to a transfer on the death of a borrower because the transfer is involuntary. But p.58 supports my reading of (d)(3).

```
if property is transferred to 
                              a joint tenant, or
                              a tenant by the entirety,
                           by 
                              devise, 
                              descent or 
                              operation of law. 
```

They rearranged (d)(3) and by rearranging it, they removed any merit to the Oxford comman argument. 
 

### Arguments for a broad interprtation of (d)(3)


Some lawyers on the New York State Bar Association listserv suggested that the transfer at death is covered by (d)(3). 

One lawyer wrote: 

> I think that (d)(3) applies to your situation.  The first clause of that section makes "a transfer by devise,..." an exception.   I think this applies to any transfer by devise (Will) and that the next clause applies to any transfer by descent (intestacy).  I think that the joint tenant or tenant by the entirety language (which you are indicating knocks out this exception for you) only applies to that portion of the exception that pertains to a transfer by operation of law, and that it does not apply to transfers by devise or descent.  It doesn't make sense to me to connect the concepts of devise and descent with joint tenants and tenants by the entirety.

Another wrote: 

> I would agree as to (d)(3), which reads, "a transfer by devise, descent, or operation of law on the death of a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety". The phrase, "on the death of a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety", can relate only to a transfer "by operation of law", as the death of a joint tenant or spouse is a separate case from a transfer by devise or by descent. The Oxford comma appropriately separates the three different cases intended by this provision, imho.

> Broader. Makes no sense to confine (d)(3) only to joint tenancies or TBEs. Few people choose to die as a means to defeat a due-on-sale clause. 

### Arguments for narrow interpretation of (d)(3)

(1) If the broader reading makes sense for (d)(3), then why is (d)(5) in the statute?

If we read (d)(3) as applying to all transfers by devise or descent, then 

- (d)(5) is no longer necessary because "a transfer . . . resulting from the death of a borrower" would be encompassed by either a transfer by devise or by descent.
- we don't have to worry about the application of the due on sale clause at death, which doesn't make sense from the lender's perspective since a complete stranger will be in possession. 

(2) If (d)(3) is interpreted broadly and both (d)(3) and (d)(5) apply at the death of the borrower, don't statutory interpretation rules say we need to apply the narrower rule, i.e., (d)(5)? 

(3) It seems strange to interpret (d)(3) broadly --as applying to every transfer by devise or descent -- when so many of the other exemptions are narrow: 

- (5)  a transfer to a relative resulting from the death of a borrower;
- (6)  a transfer where the spouse or children of the borrower become an owner of the property;
- (7)  a transfer resulting from a decree of a dissolution of marriage, legal separation agreement, or from an incidental property settlement agreement, by which the spouse of the borrower becomes an owner of the property;
- (8)  a transfer into an inter vivos trust in which the borrower is and remains a beneficiary and which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in the property;

(4) Yes, few people choose to die as a means to defeat a due-on-sale clause. But don't banks use the due-on-sale clause so (A) they can have some control over who the borrower is and (B) they can control the loan portfolios they might carry? (I recall coming across case law that questions whether a bank can exercise a due-on-sale clause for the latter purpose, but such a legal restriction doesn't take away the bank's incentive to accelerate notes with a lower interest.) 


If (d)(3) is indeed broad, then Testator can devise real property to three strangers and the lender cannot accelerate the note, even though the interest rate is low (say 2.5%). As long as the new owners continue to make payments, the lender is powerless. That's great!

<!-- 
Personally, I don't think the exemption applies when a transfer is made to strangers because (1) then we wouldn't need the exemption in (d)(5), and (2) it doesn't make sense from a lender's perspective -- someone completely unrelated to the borrower is now in the position of the borrower.
