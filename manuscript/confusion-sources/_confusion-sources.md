### Unanswered Questions Under the Law 

Questions could be unanswered because there is no legislation that answers them. 

New York's revocable trust legislation in 1995 serves as a notable example of legislation aimed at addressing unanswered legal questions.

In its April 14, 1995 report, New York's EPTL-SCPA Legislative Advisory Committee recommended new legislation on revocable lifetime trusts because it "concluded that legislation would not only be helpful but was, in fact, necessary to clear up serious unanswered questions under New York law, especially in the area of execution and funding." 

The report references case law that reaches inconsistent results. For example, it wrote, "In some cases, it would appear that at least a signature is required, but in many situations even oral trusts are recognized." 


### Ambiguity 

Words can have more than one meaning.
